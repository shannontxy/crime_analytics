# crime_analytics

The primary goal of our project is to predict the type of crime that will happen, and to predict potential recividious behaviour in released convicts.  After the model is able to accurately predict criminals who are more likely to recommit, relevant agencies can narrow down their scope to a more targeted group as they identify, delve into and analyse any factors that can potentially reveal signs of higher propensity for recidivism. This helps authorities better allocate their limited resources, and make their efforts in re-integrating ex-convicts back to society more effective. It must be noted, however, that statistical efficiency does not equal true efficiency of a system of law enforcement - it may be argued that a truly efficient system of law enforcement is once that focuses more on systemic changes to eliminate the reasons that drive people to commit crimes in the first place. Our project, however, excludes such arguments and focuses solely on providing authorities with a clearer picture on what types of crime will be committed and the potential tendency of an offender to recommit crimes.The task of analysing the motivations behind the offenders actions falls onto those who may choose to utilise our project in the future.
